  bestPractices: `
  - Events are scoped to this workspace. Pick an event type, then optionally narrow to specific workflows (empty selection watches all).
  - This workflow must be deployed for the trigger to fire, and it never receives events about itself.
  - Runs started by this trigger never emit workspace events, so side-effect workflows cannot chain or loop.
  - Alert conditions (latency spike, cost threshold, consecutive failures, ...) fire at most once per cooldown window; plain events fire on every occurrence.
  - Compose any blocks downstream (Slack, email, webhooks, custom logic) to act on the event payload.

     * The event is what the card is about; the workflow filter narrows it and
     * stays optional, because an empty selection watches every workflow rather
     * than none. The per-condition thresholds are already gated on the event,
     * so naming them would only crowd the line.
